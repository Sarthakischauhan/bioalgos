# Bioinformatics Algorithms 

Some bioinformatics algorithm implementations by me to practice and understand how they work for CS123 course at SJSU by Wendy Lee. Most of these algos are checked and does have a way for you to check their output.

# Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Django**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**

# First things first
1. Create a virtual envrionment
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate it
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install requirements for django project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# To contribute
1. Running backend code
Once you are done installing. You can do 
```bash 
python manage.py runserver
```

2. React based frontend code
```
cd frontend 
npm install
npm run dev
```
